        <p>Your family and friends are going to be your biggest supporters during this time. Don't push them away. Have those difficult conversations. I know, itâ€™s easier said than done. But do it, and do it today. Trust me you will feel much better. </p>
        <p> Also, talk to your co-workers, to your seniors/ managers- ask them for advice. Take a look in your neighborhood- are there any jobs you qualify for?</p>
